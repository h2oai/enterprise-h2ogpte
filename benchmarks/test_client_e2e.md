However, we can calculate it based on the information provided.
E                   
E                   The document states that the total revenues of Coca-Cola FEMSA increased by 12.0% to Ps. 57,357 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of the previous year. It also states that the volume growth in Mexico was 7.12%.
E                   
E                   Assuming that the volume growth in Mexico was entirely due to an increase in revenue, we can estimate the revenue growth in Mexico using the following formula:
E                   
E                   Revenue growth in Mexico = Total revenue growth x Volume growth in Mexico
E                   
E                   Substituting the values given in the document, we get:
E                   
E                   Revenue growth in Mexico = 12.0% x 7.12%
E                   Revenue growth in Mexico = 8.54%

In the first quarter of 2023, gross profit in Mexico decreased by 8.9% compared to the previous year's first quarter, and gross margin contracted by 100 basis points to 47.4%. The company attributed this margin decrease to an increase in raw material costs, such as sweeteners and concentrate, which was partially offset by favorable raw material hedging initiatives and the appreciation of the Mexican Peso as applied to dollar-denominated raw material costs. However, in the second quarter of 2023, the company reported that excluding the integration of Cristal bulk water business, volume would have increased by 4.8% in Mexico, and on a comparable basis, excluding currency translation effects, total revenues would have increased by 17.9%. This suggests that without the impact of the Cristal bulk water business and currency translation effects, gross profit may have been higher in Mexico during the second quarter of 2023.
