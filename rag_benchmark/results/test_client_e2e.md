However, it is mentioned that income tax as a percentage of income before taxes increased due to "inflationary effects across our territories" (Page 5).

While inflation is not directly linked to gross profit, it is possible that inflation may have contributed to the increase in raw material costs, which in turn affected gross profit.

E               
E               E = mgL
E               
E               where E is the energy, m is the mass of the skier, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and L is the length of the slope.
E               
E               The energy of the skier is conserved throughout the motion, so the initial energy at the top of the slope is equal to the final energy at the bottom of the slope. Since the skier starts from rest, the initial kinetic energy is zero, and the initial potential energy is given by:
E               
E               E_initial = mgh
E               
E               where h is the height of the slope.
E               
E               At the bottom of the slope, the skier's kinetic energy is given by:
E               
E               E_final = (1/2)mv^2
E               
E               where v is the final velocity of the skier.
E               
E               Since the energy is conserved, we can set up the equation:
E               
E               mgh = (1/2)mv^2
E               
E               Solving for v, we get:
E               
E               v = sqrt(2gh)
E               
E               Plugging in the values given in the image (h = 40 m, g = 9.81 m/s^2), we get:
E               
E               v = sqrt(2 \* 9.81 \* 40) = 39.6 m/s
E               
E               Therefore, the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope is 39.6 m/s.', question: 'Answer question in the image'

The solution to this problem is given as 39.6 m/s. This answer is derived from the equation v = √(2gL), where v is the velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and L is the length of the slope (80 m).
E               
E               To arrive at this answer, we need to follow these steps:
E               
E               1. Identify the given values: H = 40 m, L = 80 m, and g = 9.81 m/s^2.
E               2. Use the equation v = √(2gL) to calculate the velocity at the bottom of the slope.
E               3. Plug in the values: v = √(2 * 9.81 * 80) = √1567.2 ≈ 39.6 m/s.

The solution provided by the student involves the conservation of energy, which is correct. Let's go through the steps to determine the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope.
E               
E               1. **Conservation of Energy**: The energy of the skier at the start is equal to the energy at the end.
E               2. **Initial Energy (Potential Energy)**: \( E = mgh \)
E                  - \( m = \) mass of the skier (not given, but we can assume unit mass for simplicity)
E                  - \( g = 9.81 \, m/s^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity)
E                  - \( h = 40 \, m \) (height)
E               3. **Final Energy (Kinetic Energy)**: \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \)
E               4. **Setting up the equation**:
E                  \[ mgL = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]
E                  - \( L = 80 \, m \) (length of the slope)
E               5. **Solving for \( v \)**:
E                  \[ mgL = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]
E                  \[ gL = \frac{1}{2}v^2 \]
E                  \[ v = \sqrt{2gL} \]
E                  \[ v = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 80} \]
E                  \[ v = \sqrt{1569.6} \]
E                  \[ v \approx 39.6 \, m/s \]
E               
E               The student's final answer is \( 39.6 \, m/s \), which is correct. The error in the initial analysis was in the calculation step where the square root should have been correctly evaluated.
E               
E               Therefore, the correct speed of the skier at the bottom is approximately \( 39.6 \, m/s \).', question: 'Answer question in the image'

E               
E               The solution is derived using the conservation of energy principle:
E               - At the start, the skier has potential energy: E = mgH (where H = 40 m)
E               - At the end, this potential energy is converted to kinetic energy: E = ½mv²
E               
E               The student solved the equation mgL = ½mv² by rearranging to v = √(2gL)
E               - g = 9.81 m/s²
E               - L = 80 m
E               
E               Calculating: v = √(2 × 9.81 × 80) = 39.6 m/s
E

E               
E               The problem details are:
E               - Starting height (H) = 40 m
E               - Slope length (L) = 80 m
E               - Gravitational acceleration (g) = 9.81 m/s²
E               
E               Solution steps:
E               1. At the start, the skier has potential energy: E = mgh
E               2. At the bottom, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy: E = ½mv²
E               
E               Solving for velocity:

E               The student's solution is correct.

## Cost Model
```
    # COST START
    # Cost for 1K input/output tokens for each model, in USD
    # Self-hosted OSS 13/34/70b models are estimated at $2/h for 4-way A100 ($50k/3 years) and concurrency of 5 and 20 tokens/sec.
    # So 1000 output tokens takes 50s and costs 50s / 5 * $2 / 3600s = $0.005 (4-GPU), $0.0025 for 2-GPU, $0.00125 for 1-GPU.
    # Self-hosted OSS 7b models can run on $0.3/h systems with 50 tokens/s, also concurrency 5.
    # So 1000 output tokens takes 20s and costs 20s / 5 * $0.3 / 3600s = $0.0005 (1 GPU)
    # Cost for input tokens is scaled down by factor of 3
    # so input costs 3x less than output for codellama and mistral-based models with 32k, 20x less for Yi-34B based with 200K
    # For models under 7B, we cut the price in half again, since can do 2x as many tokens/s.
