E               To arrive at this answer, we need to follow these steps:
E               
E               1. Identify the given values: H = 40 m, L = 80 m, and g = 9.81 m/s^2.

E               
E               The solution is derived using the conservation of energy principle:
E               - At the start, the skier has potential energy: E = mgH (where H = 40 m)
E               - At the end, this potential energy is converted to kinetic energy: E = ½mv²
E               
E               The student solved the equation mgL = ½mv² by rearranging to v = √(2gL)
E               - g = 9.81 m/s²
E               - L = 80 m
E               
E               Calculating: v = √(2 × 9.81 × 80) = 39.6 m/s
E               
E               The solution demonstrates that on a frictionless slope, the initial potential energy is completely converted to kinetic energy, allowing the skier to reach a final velocity of 39.6 m/s at the bottom of the slope.', question: 'Answer the question'

## Cost Model
```
    # COST START
    # Cost for 1K input/output tokens for each model, in USD
    # Self-hosted OSS 13/34/70b models are estimated at $2/h for 4-way A100 ($50k/3 years) and concurrency of 5 and 20 tokens/sec.
    # So 1000 output tokens takes 50s and costs 50s / 5 * $2 / 3600s = $0.005 (4-GPU), $0.0025 for 2-GPU, $0.00125 for 1-GPU.
    # Self-hosted OSS 7b models can run on $0.3/h systems with 50 tokens/s, also concurrency 5.
    # So 1000 output tokens takes 20s and costs 20s / 5 * $0.3 / 3600s = $0.0005 (1 GPU)
    # Cost for input tokens is scaled down by factor of 3
    # so input costs 3x less than output for codellama and mistral-based models with 32k, 20x less for Yi-34B based with 200K
    # For models under 7B, we cut the price in half again, since can do 2x as many tokens/s.
