E               
E               1. Accelerated AI capabilities: H2O.ai played a key role in driving CBA's artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. This includes the development and deployment of AI models across various business areas, which helped in enhancing customer experiences and process simplification.
E               
E               2. Responsible AI: H2O.ai collaborated with CBA in implementing responsible AI practices. This involved ensuring that AI models were designed and used in a way that was ethical, transparent, and accountable, while also considering privacy and security concerns.
E               
E               3. AI Policy: H2O.ai supported CBA in the creation and implementation of its AI Policy. This policy was designed to govern the responsible use of AI within the bank, and it was based on the Australian AI Ethics Principles.
E               
E               4. AI training: H2O.ai provided training to CBA employees to ensure safe and secure deployment of AI across the organization. This training helped in building AI capability among the employees, enabling them to leverage AI for delivering more personalized experiences to customers.
E               
E               5. Cybersecurity: H2O.ai's partnership with CBA likely extended to the realm of cybersecurity, as the bank mentions investing in risk assessment tools, data, and processes to better understand and detect financial crime risks. This could imply that H2O.ai's AI solutions were used to enhance CBA's cybersecurity posture.
