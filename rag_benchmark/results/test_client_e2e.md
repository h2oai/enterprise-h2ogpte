E               
E               We can find the values for each of these components in the document context, but we cannot directly add them up to get the total noninterest income for Corporate and Investment Banking. The reason is that some of these components are reported on a net basis, meaning that they already include the effects of certain transactions or adjustments.
E               
E               For example, the "Net gains from trading activities" component includes both the gains and losses from trading activities, so it cannot be simply added to the other components, which are reported on an absolute basis.
E               
E               However, we can provide an estimate of the total noninterest income for Corporate and Investment Banking by adding up the absolute values of the components that are reported on an absolute basis:
E
