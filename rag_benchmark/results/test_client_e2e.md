E               
E               Since the backlog represents the total amount of work that has been contracted but not yet recognized as revenue, we can add the total backlog for 2022 ($7,622) to the FY 2022 revenue ($8,535) to get an estimate of the total revenue generated by the Critical Mission Solutions segment in 2022.

E               1. Deposit-related fees

E               
E               We can find the values for each of these components in the document context, but we cannot directly add them up to get the total noninterest income for Corporate and Investment Banking. The reason is that some of these components are already included in the total noninterest income figure for the segment, while others are not.
E               
E               For example, the document context provides the following values for Corporate and Investment Banking:
E               
E               1. Deposit-related fees: $1,068 million
E               2. Lending-related fees: $769 million
E               3. Investment banking fees: $1,492 million
E               4. Net gains from trading activities: $1,886 million
E               5. Other: $1,294 million
E               
E               However, these values do not add up to the total noninterest income for Corporate and Investment Banking, which is $3,631 million. This is because the values for deposit-related fees, lending-related fees, and investment banking fees are already included in the total noninterest income figure.
E               
E               Without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the total noninterest income for Corporate and Investment Banking based solely on the provided document context.</s', question: 'What was total noninterest income for corporate and investment banking?'
