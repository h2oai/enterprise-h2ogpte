E               From the document:

E

E               1. Calculate the total interest income and expense for 1H22 (April 2, 2021, to October 1, 2021):

E               Interest expense for 1H22 = Interest expense for FY2022 - Interest expense for 2H22
E               Interest expense for 1H22 = $365 - ($365 / 2) = $365 - $182.5 = $182.5 million
E               2. Calculate the 1H22 net interest expense:
E               Net interest expense for 1H22 = Interest income for 1H22 - Interest expense for 1H22
E               Net interest expense for 1H22 = $8.5 - $182.5 = -$174 million
E

## Cost Model
```
    # COST START
    # Cost for 1K input/output tokens for each model, in USD
    # Self-hosted OSS 13/34/70b models are estimated at $2/h for 4-way A100 ($50k/3 years) and concurrency of 5 and 20 tokens/sec.
    # So 1000 output tokens takes 50s and costs 50s / 5 * $2 / 3600s = $0.005 (4-GPU), $0.0025 for 2-GPU, $0.00125 for 1-GPU.
    # Self-hosted OSS 7b models can run on $0.3/h systems with 50 tokens/s, also concurrency 5.
    # So 1000 output tokens takes 20s and costs 20s / 5 * $0.3 / 3600s = $0.0005 (1 GPU)
    # Cost for input tokens is scaled down by factor max(1, context_length / 10k),
    # so input costs 3x less than output for codellama and mistral-based models with 32k, 20x less for Yi-34B based with 200K
    # For 1.8B model, we cut the price in half again, since can do 2x as many tokens/s.
