   - [Femsa](https://enterprise-h2ogpt-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/Coca-Cola-FEMSA-Results-1Q23-vf-2.pdf) missing: ['27,229'], reply: 'According to the information provided in the document, the revenue of Mexico is not explicitly stated. However, we can calculate it based on the information provided.
E               
E               The document states that the total revenues of Coca-Cola FEMSA increased by 12.0% to Ps. 57,357 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of the previous year. It also states that the volume growth in Mexico was 7.12%.
E               
E               Assuming that the volume growth in Mexico was entirely due to an increase in revenue, we can estimate the revenue growth in Mexico using the following formula:
E               
E               Revenue growth in Mexico = Total revenue growth x Volume growth in Mexico
E               
E               Substituting the values given in the document, we get:
E               
E               Revenue growth in Mexico = 12.0% x 7.12%
E               Revenue growth in Mexico = 8.54%
E               
E               Therefore, the revenue of Mexico in the first quarter of 2023 increased by 8.54% compared to the same period of the previous year.
E               
E               However, the document does not provide the actual revenue figure for Mexico, so we cannot determine the exact revenue amount.', question: 'What was the revenue of Mexico?'
