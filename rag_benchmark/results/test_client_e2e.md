E               
E               To calculate the revenue of Mexico, we need to subtract the total revenues of Central America (excluding Mexico) from the total revenues of Mexico & Central America.
E               
E               First, let's find the total revenues of Central America:
E               
E               Total revenues of Mexico & Central America - Total revenues of Mexico = Total revenues of Central America
E

E               
E               Total revenues of Mexico & Central America - Total revenues of Central America = Revenue of Mexico
E

E               From the document:

E               Since the document states that the twelve months ended April 1, 2023, includes the first six months of fiscal 2023, we can infer that the net interest expense for the first half of fiscal 2022 (1H22) would be:
