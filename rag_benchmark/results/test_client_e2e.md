The problem asks for the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope, given the height of the slope (H = 40 m) and the length of the slope (L = 80 m). The student has used the conservation of energy principle, which states that the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant if there are no external forces acting on it. The student has calculated the final velocity (v) of the skier using the initial potential energy (E_initial) and the final potential energy (E_final), which is zero at the bottom of the slope. The final answer provided by the student is 39.6 m/s.
E               
E               However, upon reviewing the solution provided by the student, it appears that there is an error in the calculation. The correct calculation should be:
E               
E               E_initial = mgh = mgL
E               E_final = 0 (since the skier is at the bottom of the slope)
E               
E               Using the conservation of energy principle, we can set up the equation:
E               
E               mgh = 0.5mv^2
E               
E               Since the mass (m) is present on both sides of the equation, we can cancel it out:
E               
E               gh = 0.5v^2
E               
E               Now, we can solve for v:
E               
E               v^2 = 2gh
E               v^2 = 2(9.81)(80)
E               v^2 = 1567.2
E               v = √1567.2
E               v ≈ 39.53 m/s
E               
E               Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 39.53 m/s, rounded to two decimal places.', question: 'Answer question in the image'

E               
E               Start: E = mgh
E               End: E = (1/2)mv^2
E               
E               Since the potential energy at the end is zero, we can set up the equation:

E

E               
E               where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2).
E               
E               Solving for v, we get:
E               
E               v = sqrt(2gL) = sqrt(2 \* 9.81 \* 80) = sqrt(1567.2) ≈ 39.46 m/s
E               
E               Rounding off to two decimal places, the final answer is approximately 39.46 m/s.
E               
E               However, the student's answer is 39.6 m/s, which is close but not exactly correct. The discrepancy is likely due to rounding errors in the calculation.', question: 'Answer the question'

The student has used the conservation of energy principle to calculate the final velocity (v) of the skier, given the height (H) and length (L) of the slope. The student has calculated the final velocity as 39.6 m/s, which is correct. The calculation is as follows:
E               
E               At the beginning, the skier has only potential energy, given by E\_initial = mgh, where m is the mass of the skier, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the slope. At the end, the skier has only kinetic energy, given by E\_final = 1/2 mv^2. According to the conservation of energy, E\_initial = E\_final, so we have:
E               
E               mgH = 1/2 mv^2
E               
E               Solving for v, we get:
E               
E               v = sqrt(2gH) = sqrt(2 * 9.81 m/s^2 * 40 m) = 39.6 m/s

The problem asks for the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope, given the height of the slope (H = 40 m) and the length of the slope (L = 80 m).
E               
E               The student has used the conservation of energy principle to solve the problem. The conservation of energy principle states that the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant if there are no external forces acting on it. In this case, the initial potential energy (E_initial) at the start of the slope is equal to the final kinetic energy (E_final) at the bottom of the slope, as there is no friction to cause energy loss.
E               
E               The student has calculated the final velocity (v) of the skier using the formula:
E               
E               v = √(2 * g * L)
E               
E               where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²) and L is the length of the slope (80 m). Plugging in the values, we get:
E               
E               v = √(2 * 9.81 * 80) = 39.6 m/s
E

E               
E               1. The student uses the conservation of energy principle, which states that the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant if there are no external forces acting on it. This means that the initial potential energy (E_initial) is equal to the final potential energy (E_final).
E               
E               2. The initial potential energy (E_initial) is calculated using the formula E = mgh, where m is the mass of the skier, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), and h is the height of the slope (H = 40 m). The student calculates this as mgL, which seems to be a mistake as it should be mgH.
E               
E               3. The final potential energy (E_final) is zero at the bottom of the slope.
E               
E               4. The student then equates the initial potential energy to the final kinetic energy (E_final = ½mv²), which is the form of energy the skier has at the bottom of the slope. This gives the equation mgL = ½mv².
E               
E               5. Solving for v, the student gets v = √(2gL) = √(2 * 9.81 * 80) = 39.6 m/s.
E               
E               So, according to the student's solution, the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope is 39.6 m/s. However, there is a mistake in the calculation of the initial potential energy. If we correct this, the final answer should be v = √(2gH) = √(2 * 9.81 * 40) = 29.4 m/s. Therefore, the student's final answer of 39.6 m/s is incorrect.', question: 'Answer the question'

The problem asks for the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope. The solution provided includes a diagram of the slope with a start and finish point, and a calculation of the skier's speed using the conservation of energy principle. The solution concludes that the skier's speed at the bottom is 39.6 m/s.
E               
E               To verify the correctness of the solution, we can use the given formula for the conservation of energy:
E               
E               mgL = kmv^2
E               
E               where m is the mass of the skier, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), L is the length of the slope (80 m), k is the coefficient of kinetic friction (which is 0 since the slope is frictionless), and v is the final velocity of the skier.
E               
E               Substituting the given values, we get:
E               
E               mgL = kmv^2
E               
E               m * 9.81 * 80 = 0 * v^2
E               
E               v^2 = (m * 9.81 * 80) / 0
E               
E               v^2 = 0
E               
E               v = 0 m/s
E               
E               This result is incorrect, as the skier's speed at the bottom should be non-zero. The mistake in the solution lies in the calculation of the final velocity. The correct calculation should be:
E               
E               v = sqrt((2 * m * g * L) / k)
E               
E               Since the slope is frictionless, k = 0, and the formula simplifies to:
E               
E               v = sqrt((2 * m * g * L))
E               
E               Now, substituting the given values, we get:
E               
E               v = sqrt((2 * m * 9.81 * 80))
E               
E               v = sqrt((2 * m * 784.8))
E               
E               v = sqrt(1569.6 * m)
E               
E               v = sqrt(1569.6) * sqrt(m)
E               
E               v = 39.6 * sqrt(m)
E               
E               Therefore, the correct skier's speed at the bottom is 39.6 * sqrt(m) m/s.
E               
E               In conclusion, the solution provided in the image is incorrect, and the correct skier's speed at the bottom is 39.6 * sqrt(m) m/s.', question: 'Answer question in the image'

The student used the conservation of energy principle to calculate the final velocity of the skier at the bottom of the slope. The initial potential energy (E_initial) is equal to the final kinetic energy (E_final), which is zero at the bottom of the slope. The student's calculation is as follows:
E               
E               E_initial = mgL
E               E_final = 0.5 * m * v^2
E               
E               Since E_initial = E_final, we have:
E               
E               mgL = 0.5 * m * v^2
E

The student has attempted to solve the problem using the conservation of energy principle, which is a valid approach. However, there is a mistake in the calculation of the final velocity \( v \).
E               
E               The student correctly identifies that the initial potential energy \( E_i \) at the start of the slope is equal to the final potential energy \( E_f \) at the bottom of the slope, given by \( E_f = mgh \), where \( m \) is the mass of the skier, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height of the slope.
E               
E               The student then calculates the initial kinetic energy \( E_i \) as \( E_i = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( v \) is the initial velocity at the start of the slope. However, the student incorrectly equates \( E_i \) to \( E_f \) and solves for \( v \), which leads to an incorrect final velocity.
E               
E               To correct the solution, we should first calculate the final kinetic energy \( E_f \) using the final velocity \( v \) and the mass \( m \), and then equate it to the initial potential energy \( E_i \) to solve for \( v \). The correct equation should be:
E               
E               \( E_f = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \)
E               
E               \( E_f = mgh \)
E               
E               Equating the two expressions for \( E_f \) and solving for \( v \) gives us:
E               
E               \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mgh \)
E               
E               \( v^2 = 2gh \)
E               
E               \( v = \sqrt{2gh} \)
E               
E               Substituting the given values \( m = 80 \) kg, \( g = 9.81 \) m/s², and \( h = 40 \) m, we get:
E

The student has attempted to solve the problem using the conservation of energy principle, which is a valid approach. However, there is a mistake in the calculation of the final velocity \( v \).
E               
E               The student correctly identifies that the initial potential energy \( E_i \) at the start of the slope is equal to the final potential energy \( E_f \) at the bottom of the slope, given by \( E_f = mgh \), where \( m \) is the mass of the skier, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height of the slope.
E               
E               The student then calculates the initial kinetic energy \( E_i \) as \( E_i = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( v \) is the initial velocity at the start of the slope. However, the student incorrectly equates \( E_i \) to \( E_f \) and solves for \( v \), which leads to an incorrect final velocity.
E               
E               To correct the solution, we should first calculate the final kinetic energy \( E_f \) using the final velocity \( v \) and the mass \( m \), and then equate it to the initial potential energy \( E_i \) to solve for \( v \). The correct equation should be:
E               
E               \( E_f = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \)
E               
E               \( E_f = mgh \)
E               
E               Equating the two expressions for \( E_f \) and solving for \( v \) gives us:
E               
E               \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mgh \)
E               
E               \( v^2 = 2gh \)
E               
E               \( v = \sqrt{2gh} \)
E               
E               Substituting the given values \( m = 80 \) kg, \( g = 9.81 \) m/s², and \( h = 40 \) m, we get:

E               
E               1. At the start (H = 40 m), the potential energy is E\_initial = mgh = m * 9.81 * 40.
E               2. At the end (L = 80 m), the potential energy is E\_final = mgh = m * 9.81 * 0 (since h = 0 at the end).
E               3. The total mechanical energy (E\_total) is conserved, so E\_initial = E\_final + E\_kinetic.
E               4. The kinetic energy at the end is E\_kinetic = 0.5 * m * v^2.
E               5. Solving for v, we get v = sqrt(2 * (E\_initial - E\_final) / m).
E               
E               The student has calculated the final velocity (v) to be approximately 39.6 m/s.
E               
E               To verify the student's solution, we can use the conservation of energy principle and the formula for potential energy. The initial potential energy (E\_initial) is equal to the final potential energy (E\_final) plus the final kinetic energy (E\_kinetic). Since the slope is frictionless, all the initial potential energy is converted into kinetic energy at the bottom. Therefore, E\_initial = E\_kinetic.
E               
E               Using the formula for potential energy, we can calculate E\_initial as mgh = m * 9.81 * 40. Then, we can calculate E\_kinetic as 0.5 * m * v^2. Setting E\_initial equal to E\_kinetic and solving for v, we should get the same result as the student's calculation.

The correct calculation involves using the conservation of energy principle, where the potential energy at the start is equal to the kinetic energy at the bottom.

The correct speed at the bottom of the slope can be calculated using the conservation of energy principle. 
E               
E               The potential energy at the start is given by \( mgh \), where \( m \) is the mass of the skier, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 \, m/s^2 \)), and \( h \) is the height (40 meters). At the end, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is given by \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \).
E               
E               By equating the energies, we get:

E               mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2

E

E               
E               Solving for \( v \), we get:
E               \[
E               v^2 = 2gh

E               \[
E               v = \sqrt{2gh}
E               \]
E               
E               Substituting the given values:
E               \[
E               v = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 40}
E               \]
E               \[
E               v = \sqrt{784.8}

E               \[

E               
E               The student correctly applied the conservation of energy principle, stating that the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant if there are no external forces acting on it. The student also correctly identified the initial potential energy (E_initial) as mgL and the final kinetic energy (E_final) as (1/2)mv^2. 
E               
E               However, the student's calculation of the final velocity (v) is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:
E               
E               mgL = (1/2)mv^2
E               v = sqrt(2gL)
E

The student attempts to solve the problem using the conservation of energy principle, which is a valid approach. However, there is a mistake in the calculation of the final velocity (v).
E               
E               The correct solution involves calculating the final kinetic energy (E_f) using the final velocity (v) and the mass (m), and then equating it to the initial potential energy (E_i) to solve for v. The correct equation is:
E               
E               E_f = 1/2mv^2
E               E_f = mgh
E               Equating the two expressions for E_f and solving for v gives:
E               v^2 = 2gh
E               v = sqrt(2gh)
E

E               v ≈ 35.43 m/s

E               
E               The student's solution is as follows:
E               
E               1. At the start (H = 40 m), the potential energy is E_initial = mgh = m * 9.81 * 40.
E               2. At the end (L = 80 m), the potential energy is E_final = mgh = m * 9.81 * 0 (since h = 0 at the end).
E               3. The total mechanical energy (E_total) is conserved, so E_initial = E_final + E_kinetic.
E               4. The kinetic energy at the end is E_kinetic = 0.5 * m * v^2.

The skier slides down the slope with a starting height of 40 meters and a final height of 80 meters. The skier's speed at the bottom is calculated using the conservation of energy principle and the formula for potential energy.
E               
E               The skier's initial potential energy (E_initial) is equal to the final potential energy (E_final) plus the final kinetic energy (E_kinetic). Since the slope is frictionless, all the initial potential energy is converted into kinetic energy at the bottom. Therefore, E_initial = E_final + E_kinetic.
E               
E               Using the formula for potential energy, we can calculate E_initial as mgh = m * 9.81 * 40. Then, we can solve for v using the formula v = sqrt(2 * (E_initial - E_final) / m). Since E_final = 0, this simplifies to v = sqrt(2 * E_initial / m).
E               
E               The skier's final kinetic energy (E_kinetic) is equal to the final potential energy (E_final) minus the initial potential energy (E_initial). Since E_initial = mgh, we can rewrite E_kinetic as E_kinetic = E_final - E_initial.
E               
E               Substituting the values, we get E_kinetic = 0.5 * m * v^2 - m * 9.81 * 40.
E               
E               Solving for v, we get v = sqrt(2 * (E_initial - E_final) / m).
E               
E               Plugging in the values, we get v = sqrt(2 * (m * 9.81 * 40 - 0) / m).
E               
E               Simplifying, we get v = sqrt(196.44).
E               
E               Rounding off the final answer to two decimal places, we get v ≈ 39.6 m/s.

E               Therefore, the skier's speed at the bottom of the frictionless slope is approximately 39.6 m/s.', question: 'Answer question in the image'

E               
E               The student's solution to the physics problem is incorrect. The student has attempted to solve the problem using the conservation of energy principle, which is a valid approach. However, there is a mistake in the calculation of the final velocity \( v \).
E               
E               The student correctly identifies that the initial potential energy \( E_i \) at the start of the slope is equal to the final potential energy \( E_f \) at the bottom of the slope, given by \( E_f = mgh \), where \( m \) is the mass of the skier, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height of the slope.
E               
E               The student then calculates the initial kinetic energy \( E_i \) as \( E_i = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( v \) is the initial velocity at the start of the slope. However, the student incorrectly equates \( E_i \) to \( E_f \) and solves for \( v \), which leads to an incorrect final velocity.
E               
E               To correct the solution, we should first calculate the final kinetic energy \( E_f \) using the final velocity \( v \) and the mass \( m \), and then equate it to the initial potential energy \( E_i \) to solve for \( v \). The correct equation should be:

Here's a breakdown of the problem and its solution:
E               
E               1. The problem involves a skier sliding down a frictionless slope with a height of 40 meters and a length of 80 meters.
E               
E               2. The student correctly identified this as a conservation of energy problem, where the potential energy at the start equals the kinetic energy at the end.
E               
E               3. The equations used are:
E                  Start (potential energy): E = mgh
E                  End (kinetic energy): E = 1/2 mv²
E               
E               4. By equating these energies and simplifying, we get: gh = 1/2 v²
E               
E               5. Solving for v: v = √(2gh)
E               
E               6. Plugging in the values:
E                  g = 9.81 m/s² (standard gravity)
E                  h = 40 m (given in the problem)
E               
E               7. The final calculation: v = √(2 * 9.81 * 40) = 39.6 m/s
E

The student has attempted to solve the problem using the conservation of energy principle, which is a valid approach. However, there is a mistake in the calculation of the final velocity \( v \).
E               
E               The student correctly identifies that the initial potential energy \( E_i \) at the start of the slope is equal to the final potential energy \( E_f \) at the bottom of the slope, given by \( E_f = mgh \), where \( m \) is the mass of the skier, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height of the slope.
E               
E               The student then calculates the initial kinetic energy \( E_i \) as \( E_i = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), where \( v \) is the initial velocity at the start of the slope. However, the student incorrectly equates \( E_i \) to \( E_f \) and solves for \( v \), which leads to an incorrect final velocity.
E               
E               To correct the solution, we should first calculate the final kinetic energy \( E_f \) using the final velocity \( v \) and the mass \( m \), and then equate it to the initial potential energy \( E_i \) to solve for \( v \). The correct equation should be:
E               
E               \( E_f = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \)
E               
E               \( E_f = mgh \)
E               
E               Equating the two expressions for \( E_f \) and solving for \( v \) gives us:
E               
E               \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mgh \)
E               
E               \( v^2 = 2gh \)
E               
E               \( v = \sqrt{2gh} \)
E               
E               Substituting the given values \( m = 80 \) kg, \( g = 9.81 \) m/s², and \( h = 40 \) m, we get:
E               
E               \( v = \sqrt{2 \times 80 \times 9.81 \times 40} \)

E               
E               1. The conservation of energy principle is applied, stating that the skier's initial potential energy (mgh) equals the final kinetic energy (1/2 mv^2) at the bottom.
E               
E               2. The potential energy at the start is calculated as mgh = mg(40 m) using the given height of 40 m.
E               
E               3. Setting the initial and final energies equal, the equation mv^2/2 = mgh is derived.
E               
E               4. Solving for v, the final speed is calculated as v = sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(2 * 9.81 * 80) = 39.6 m/s.

   - [imagejonp](https://enterprise-h2ogpt-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/physics.png) missing: ['28.0', 'm/s']['28.0', 'ms^{-1}'], reply: 'According to the image analysis, the student's solution to the physics problem is incorrect because they did not correctly apply the conservation of energy principle. While the student mentions the concept of conservation of energy, the provided solution doesn't accurately reflect the calculations needed to solve for the final velocity. 
E               
E               The image analysis also provides a detailed explanation of why the student's initial approach was flawed and outlines the correct steps using the equation of motion for constant acceleration:
E               
E               * **The student's mistake:** The student's solution incorrectly applies the equation of motion for constant acceleration. The student seems to have confused the equation of motion for constant velocity with the one for constant acceleration.
E               
E               * **Correct approach:** To find the skier's speed at the bottom, we need to use the equation \(v^2 = u^2 + 2as\) where \(v\) is the final velocity, \(u\) is the initial velocity (which is zero in this case), \(a\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \(s\) is the distance traveled down the slope.
E               
E               The analysis correctly identifies the problem as a physics problem involving the conservation of energy principle and the equation of motion. It also correctly states that the skier starts from a point of rest (initial velocity is zero).
E               
E               However, the student's solution doesn't provide the correct initial velocity for the skier at the top of the slope.
E               
E               The image analysis also provides the following information:
E               
E               * **The correct equation:** The analysis should use the equation \(v^2 = u^2 + 2as\) to calculate the final velocity.
E               
E               * **The importance of understanding the concept:** The student needs to understand that the concept of constant acceleration is not applicable in this scenario. The skier's velocity is increasing as they go down the slope.
E               
E               * **The need for a clear diagram:** The student should draw a clear diagram of the situation, including a coordinate system to show the direction of motion and the relevant forces.
E               
E               * **Understanding the problem:** The analysis should have mentioned that the student should have used the conservation of energy principle to find the final velocity. This principle states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. In this case, the skier's potential energy at the top of the slope is converted into kinetic energy at the bottom.
E               
E               Therefore, the image analysis suggests that the student needs to understand that the problem requires applying the concept of **conservation of energy** and the correct equation for **kinetic energy** and **potential energy**. 
E               
E               The solution provided in the document is correct for the initial part of the problem, but the student needs to understand that the final velocity at the bottom of the slope is not simply calculated by \(v = \sqrt{2gH}\).
E               
E               The student needs to consider the **initial potential energy** (at the top of the slope) and the **final kinetic energy** (at the bottom) and how they relate to the **conservation of energy**.', question: 'Answer the question'

E               * The image indicates the student used the correct formulas for potential energy and kinetic energy, demonstrating an understanding of the principles involved.
E               * The problem involves a skier sliding down a frictionless slope, implying the use of the principle of conservation of energy. The student correctly applies this principle to solve for the skier's velocity at the bottom.
E               
E               The image also provides a useful visual representation of the problem, indicating that the skier starts from a height of 40 meters and travels a distance of 80 meters down the slope.

Since the problem doesn't specify the mass of the skier and the final kinetic energy is entirely in the form of velocity (no mention of rotational energy), we can assume that the mass (m) cancels out in the equation.
E               
E               The student set up the equation E_initial = E_final, which simplifies to mgL = (1/2)mv², where L is the length of the slope. Solving for the final velocity (v), the student got:
E               
E               \[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2gL}{m}} \]
E               
E               Since m cancels out, the final velocity becomes:
E               
E               \[ v = \sqrt{2gL} \]
E               
E               Substituting the given values (g = 9.81 m/s², L = 80 m), the student calculated:
E               
E               \[ v = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 80} \]
E               
E               This calculation results in a speed of approximately 39.6 m/s, which the student rounded to two decimal places. The student's solution seems correct, and the final answer of 39.6 m/s is the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope.', question: 'Answer question in the image'

The student attempted to solve the problem using the conservation of energy principle but made a mistake in the calculation of the final velocity \( v \). The correct approach involves calculating the final kinetic energy \( E_f \) using the final velocity \( v \) and the mass \( m \), and then equating it to the initial potential energy \( E_i \) to solve for \( v \). The correct equation for the final velocity is given by:

The problem asks for the skier's speed at the bottom of the slope, given the height of the slope (H = 40 m) and the length of the slope (L = 80 m). The student used the conservation of energy principle, which states that the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant if there are no external forces acting on it. The student calculated the final velocity (v) of the skier using the initial potential energy (E\_initial) and the final potential energy (E\_final), which is zero at the bottom of the slope. However, the student made an error in the calculation by using L instead of H in the final equation. The correct equation should be:
E               
E               mgH = 1/2 mv^2
E               
E               v = sqrt(2gH)
E               
E               where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2). Substituting the given values, we get:
E               
E               v = sqrt(2 \* 9.81 \* 40) = 20 \* sqrt(2 \* 9.81) = 31.3 m/s (rounded to two decimal places)
E

The student correctly identifies that the initial potential energy at the start of the slope is equal to the final potential energy at the bottom of the slope, given by E_f = mgh, where m is the mass of the skier, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the slope.
E               
E               The student then calculates the initial kinetic energy as E_i = 1/2mv^2, where v is the initial velocity at the start of the slope. However, the student incorrectly equates E_i to E_f and solves for v, which leads to an incorrect final velocity.
E               
E               To correct the solution, we should first calculate the final kinetic energy E_f using the final velocity v and the mass m, and then equate it to the initial potential energy E_i to solve for v. The correct equation should be:

## Cost Model
```
    # COST START
    # Cost for 1K input/output tokens for each model, in USD
    # Self-hosted OSS 13/34/70b models are estimated at $2/h for 4-way A100 ($50k/3 years) and concurrency of 5 and 20 tokens/sec.
    # So 1000 output tokens takes 50s and costs 50s / 5 * $2 / 3600s = $0.005 (4-GPU), $0.0025 for 2-GPU, $0.00125 for 1-GPU.
    # Self-hosted OSS 7b models can run on $0.3/h systems with 50 tokens/s, also concurrency 5.
    # So 1000 output tokens takes 20s and costs 20s / 5 * $0.3 / 3600s = $0.0005 (1 GPU)
    # Cost for input tokens is scaled down by factor of 3
    # so input costs 3x less than output for codellama and mistral-based models with 32k, 20x less for Yi-34B based with 200K
    # For models under 7B, we cut the price in half again, since can do 2x as many tokens/s.
